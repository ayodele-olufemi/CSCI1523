# Now exercise soem string handling operators and functions

# Print a character by index in a string

print("print the 5th character in s: ", s[4])


# Print a character based on a negative index

print("pring a character in s, -2 places from the end of the string: ", s[-2])


# Let's look at a range 

print("print a range in s: ", s[0:8])


# Let's test the "in" operator

print("Is 'fact' in s: ", "fact" in s)
